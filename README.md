## GoPro Hero 10 Black

### Battery Specs

```
RECORDING WHEN PLUGGED INTO A POWER SOURCE
You can use the USB-C cable that came with your camera to shoot videos and photos while your camera is plugged in to a USB-charging adapter, the GoPro Supercharger, or other external power source.

This is perfect for capturing long videos and time lapse events.

Be careful not to touch the area near the SD card slot when recording.

Disturbing the SD card could interrupt or stop the recording. Your camera will let you know if this happens. Your content will not be damaged or lost as a result of this disturbance, but you may need to restart your camera to continue.

Even though your camera is charging, the battery will not charge during recording. It will start charging when you stop recording.

You cannot record while your camera is plugged into a computer
```

Thus, when using the GoPro as a webcam, the battery drains faster than what it is able to charge, while plugged in to 3.0 USB.

```
Shooting high-resolution or high-fps video when itâ€™s warm out can cause your camera to heat up and use more power.

## Preview Stream

OBS: **Preview Stream** is not supported on GoPro Hero 10

```
When the preview stream is started, the camera starts up a UDP client and begins writing MPEG Transport Stream data to the client on port 8554. In order to stream this data, the client must implement a UDP connection that binds to the same port and decode the data.

**Start Preview Stream**

Supported Protocols:
USB
WIFI

query Parameters
port, integer
Example: port=8556

Port to use for Preview Stream. Defaults to 8554 if not set

Not supported on:

    Hero 11 Black
    **Hero 10 Black**
